        <h2>Lesson 3.1: Data Security at Home</h2>
        <img src="Camera.jpg" alt="Image of multiple cameras">
        <p>Securing your home network is something many forget, or don't realise they should be doing. However, this is a crucial part in ensuring intruders stay out, and your data is kept safe and secure.<br></br>

        <h3>Securing Your Home Network</h3>
        <h3>Securing Your Devices</h3>

    <p></p>

    <p>Your home network is the entry-point to the internet for all your devices. It is pivotal to secure it to avoid unauthorised access to you and your families data. Take a look at the various steps you can take:</p> 
    <p>Each and every single device connected to your home network must be secure, it is no use just one device being secure, because each other device that is insecure is another entry-point for a hacker to gain 
        unauthorised access into your home network. Here's what you can do:</p>

    <ul>
<div class="bullet-points"
<p><li><b>Default Usernames and Passwords:</b> The first step that is vital to be taken is changing the default username, along with the password. The username and password given at the installation of a new network, 
    although they may look secure, they are anything but. In fact, just your username alone conveys a lot of very useful information to potential hackers. When your home network username is visible to others, 
    it gives hackers an insight into a list of vulnerabilities and bugs present and that have been found in your network batch, meaning they will know exactly where to expolit your network from.</li><br></br>
    <li><b>Firewalls:</b> These are like security guards; they monitor the network and make sure nothing suspicious gains entry into the network, adding another layer of protection. </li><br></br>
    <li><b>Enabling Encryption:</b> Encryption is the randomisation of data into a random and unreadable format, with the only way of returning it into its original plaintext form being with a key. 
    What this means for the end user is, if your data does get into the wrong hands, the attacker still does not have access to your data because, they do not have the key to decrypt the data. </li><br></br>
    <li><b>Updates:</b> Manufacturers regularly release software updates and patches, these fix known flaws that attackers can use to gain unauthorised entry and si it becomes crucial that routers and all other 
        devices are all updated regularly.</li><br></br>
    </p>
    </div>
    </ul>
    
    <ul>
        <div class="bullet-points"
        <p><li><b>Passwords:</b> In order to keep your data secure you also need to keep the devices you store the data on secure too. To secure a device you need a strong, and unique password
        which contains upper amd lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Best practice in regard to passwords is not associating your passwords to yourself (this only makes it easier to guess your password),
        never reusing passwords across accounts or devices, changing your passwords regularly, and using a reputable and trustworthy password manager.</li><br></br>
        <li><b>Antiviruses:</b> Installing reputable and trustworthy antiviruses will protect your devices from malware and viruses.</li><br></br>
        <li><b>Automatic Updates:</b> Often times, there is an option to enable automatic updates, enabling this means everything that needs updating will get updated without even a click of a button from you.</li><br></br>
        <li><b>Disabling Services:</b> When services are not in use such as USB drives, it is best to disable them as this limits the potential attack vectors.</li><br></br>
        </p>
    </div>
    </ul>
</div>

    <h3>Two-Factor Authentication</h3>
    <p>Two-factor authentication (2FA) or multi-factor authentication is a secondary authentication technique which adds an extra layer of protection. It does this by requiring a second form of verification, 
        this could be through a text message, an authenticator app, or even an email code. <br></br> Enabling 2FA is a must because even if a person were to know your login credentials, they would not be able to 
        pass the secondary check so your data will remain protected.
