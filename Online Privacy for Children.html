        <h2>Lesson 2.1: Children's Privacy Rights</h2>
        <img src="Baby.jpg" alt="Image of a baby holding a balloon">
        <p>Children are among the most vulnerable individuals in terms of data privacy and users of the internet, their naive nature and lack of awareness about the many risks the internet presents, make them easy targets for exploitation 
            and data misuse. As parents or guardians, it is essential to understand how laws and regulations protect our children online, and what procedures we can take to ascertain their safety and privacy. So, safeguarding children's 
            privacy rights is not just a matter of legal compliance but also an ethical responsibility, it becomes crucial for their safety and well&nbsp;- being.<br></br>
          Laws and regulations around the globe recognise this and aim to safeguard and prioritise children's privacy rights. Let's have a look at some of these laws. </p><br></br>

    <p>Two prominent regulations that safeguard children's online privacy are COPPA and GDPR. <br></br>
        The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), in the United States, prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices in connection with the collection, use,
        and/or disclosure of personal information from and about children on the internet. COPPA imposes certain requirements on operators of websites or online services
        directed to children under 13 years of age. -Federal Trade Commission <br></br>
    The General Data Protection Act (GDPR), in the European Union, states the processing of the personal data of a child shall be lawful where the child is atleast 16 years old. 
        Where the child is below the age of 16 years, such processing shall be lawful only if and to the extent that consent is given or authorised by the holder of parental responsibility
         over the child. -GDPR<br></br>

                <div class="side-by-side4" id="side-by-side4"
                <p></p>
                <p>It is essential for children who browse the web, to access content that is safe and age-appropriate.
                    Most apps have age ratings or recommendations, these can help parents make informed decisions 
                    about the content their child can access. Ensure your child is only accessing secure websites, 
                    that have a valid https certificate, and avoid clicking on unfamiliar links or adverts. 
                </p> 
                <p>Teaching your child about online safety is just as important, if not even more important than implementing parental controls.
                    As parents you have the vital role of educating your child about the many risks associated with sharing personal information online, interacting with strangers, 
                    and accessing inappropriate content.
